    Description
    ***********

    The objective is to pick up a box which is placed in another room, behind a
    locked door. The door is also blocked by a ball which must be moved before
    the door can be unlocked. Hence, agents must learn to move the ball,
    pick up the key, open the door and pick up the object in the other
    room.

    The standard setting is cooperative, where all agents receive the reward
    when the task is completed.

    *************
    Mission Space
    *************

    "pick up the ``{color}`` box"

    ``{color}`` is the color of the box. Can be any :class:`.Color`.

    *****************
    Observation Space
    *****************

    The multi-agent observation space is a Dict mapping from agent index to
    corresponding agent observation space.

    Each agent observation is a dictionary with the following entries:

    * image : ndarray[int] of shape (view_size, view_size, :attr:`.WorldObj.dim`)
        Encoding of the agent's partially observable view of the environment,
        where the object at each grid cell is encoded as a vector:
        (:class:`.Type`, :class:`.Color`, :class:`.State`)
    * direction : int
        Agent's direction (0: right, 1: down, 2: left, 3: up)
    * mission : Mission
        Task string corresponding to the current environment configuration

    ************
    Action Space
    ************

    The multi-agent action space is a Dict mapping from agent index to
    corresponding agent action space.

    Agent actions are discrete integer values, given by:

    +-----+--------------+-----------------------------+
    | Num | Name         | Action                      |
    +=====+==============+=============================+
    | 0   | left         | Turn left                   |
    +-----+--------------+-----------------------------+
    | 1   | right        | Turn right                  |
    +-----+--------------+-----------------------------+
    | 2   | forward      | Move forward                |
    +-----+--------------+-----------------------------+
    | 3   | pickup       | Pick up an object           |
    +-----+--------------+-----------------------------+
    | 4   | drop         | Drop an object              |
    +-----+--------------+-----------------------------+
    | 5   | toggle       | Toggle / activate an object |
    +-----+--------------+-----------------------------+
    | 6   | done         | Done completing task        |
    +-----+--------------+-----------------------------+

    *******
    Rewards
    *******

    A reward of ``1 - 0.9 * (step_count / max_steps)`` is given for success,
    and ``0`` for failure.

    ***********
    Termination
    ***********

    The episode ends if any one of the following conditions is met:

    * Any agent picks up the correct box
    * Timeout (see ``max_steps``)
